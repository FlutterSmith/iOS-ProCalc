## 🌟 Features  

### 1️⃣ Basic Arithmetic  
✔️ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division  
✔️ Percentage Calculation  
✔️ Supports decimals and multi-digit numbers  

### 2️⃣ Advanced Arithmetic  
✔️ **Exponentiation** (Power calculations like `2^3`)  
✔️ **Trigonometric Functions** (sin, cos, tan)  
✔️ **Parentheses Support** (e.g., `(2+3) * 4`)  

### 3️⃣ Calculator History  
✔️ View past calculations in a **scrollable history panel**  
✔️ Tap on a previous result to reuse it  

### 4️⃣ Memory Functions  
✔️ **M+** (Memory Add) - Store values in memory  
✔️ **M-** (Memory Subtract) - Deduct values from memory  
✔️ **MR** (Memory Recall) - Retrieve stored values  
✔️ **MC** (Memory Clear) - Reset memory storage  

### 5️⃣ iOS-Style UI  
✔️ A sleek and modern **iOS-like** calculator interface  
✔️ **Color-coded buttons**:  
   - **Orange** for operations (+, -, ×, ÷)  
   - **Light gray** for functions (C, ±, %)  
   - **Dark gray** for numbers (0-9)  

### 6️⃣ Responsive Design  
✔️ Works on **all screen sizes**  
✔️ Optimized for both **phones and tablets**
